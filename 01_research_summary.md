# Step 4 — Survey of Existing Research on Spam Classification

This document summarizes relevant research papers related to email spam detection,
based on classical machine learning, deep learning, and modern transformer-based NLP.

## 1. A Plan for SPAM (Androutsopoulos et al.)
- Key contribution: Introduced Naive Bayes spam filtering.
- Methods: Bag-of-words, TF-IDF, binary NB & multinomial NB.
- Why relevant: Provides a classical ML baseline for my capstone.

## 2. Deep Learning for Spam Detection in Email (2018)
- Model: LSTM + word embeddings.
- Finding: Deep learning outperforms classical ML on informal text.
- Why relevant: Will guide my reproduction of an LSTM baseline.

## 3. Comparative Study of ML Techniques for Spam Classification (2017)
- Models: SVM, RF, LR, NB.
- Key outcome: Logistic Regression + TF-IDF is a strong baseline.
- Why relevant: Helps set classical ML baseline accuracy.

## 4. Enron Email Classification Benchmarks (2020)
- Contribution: Modern reproducible benchmarks on my Kaggle dataset.
- Why relevant: Directly comparable to my own Enron dataset performance.
